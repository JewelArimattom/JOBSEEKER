## ðŸš€ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, you will need a server environment like XAMPP or WAMP.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    gh repo clone JewelArimattom/JobFinder
    ```

2.  **Set up the server:**
    - Place the entire `CareerBridge` folder inside the `htdocs` directory (for XAMPP) or `www` directory (for WAMP).

3.  **Database Setup:**
    - Open **phpMyAdmin** from your XAMPP/WAMP control panel.
    - Create a new database named `jobfinder`.
    - Import the provided `.sql` file into the `jobfinder` database to create the necessary tables (`users`, `jobs`, `applications`, etc.).

4.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    - Open each PHP file in the `backend/` directory.
    - Verify that the database credentials at the top of each file match your local MySQL setup (the default is usually correct for a standard XAMPP installation).
    ```php
    $servername = "127.0.0.1";
    $username = "root";
    $password = "";
    $dbname = "jobfinder";
    ```

5.  **Run the project:**
    - Start the Apache and MySQL services from your XAMPP/WAMP control panel.
    - Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost/CareerBridge/frontend/`

## Usage

- **Job Seeker:** Navigate to the homepage, browse jobs, sign up for an account, apply for positions, and use the resources like the Resume Builder and AI Skill Advisor.
- **Job Provider:** Sign up with a "job provider" role, log in, post new jobs through the "Post Job" form, and view applications for your listings from your job provider dashboard.

## âœ¨ Visual Effects

This project places a strong emphasis on a high-quality user experience through various visual effects:

- **Interactive Globe:** A 3D particle sphere on the homepage that reacts to mouse movement and periodically "pulses."
- **Animated Backgrounds:** Pages like the profile and application forms feature dynamic, animated backgrounds (e.g., Dot Grid, Constellation, Aurora) for a modern feel.
- **Glassmorphism:** Content cards often use a semi-transparent, blurred background effect to float above the animated backdrops while maintaining readability.
- **Smooth Animations:** Elements fade in and slide up on scroll, and interactive elements have clean hover and transition effects.
